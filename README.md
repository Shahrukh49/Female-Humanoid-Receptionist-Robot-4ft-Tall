This is a research based project, its a Female Humanoid Receptionist Robot. She is 4ft tall and moves via three omni wheels. The face is a TFT Screen which gives animation of eyes. The Robot is Bluetooth, IoT enabled. It can be controlled from anywhere in the World. A camera is also mounted, the image is streamed to the user which is controlling the robot. 

The next step was to implement Machine Learning and NLP so that it can move on its own.
